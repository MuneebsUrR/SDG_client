                      <p class="text-lg">As per the United Nations, extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. Hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods. 2 billion people in the world do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. In 2019, 144 million children under the age of 5 were stunted, and 47 million were affected by wasting. According to the United Nations, Along with conflict, climate shocks and the locust crisis, the pandemic poses an additional threat to food systems. Civil security and declining food production have all contributed to food scarcity and high food prices. Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger and poverty, improving food security, creating employment and building resilience to disasters and shocks.</p>`,

In the words of Soka Gakkai International President Daisaku Ikeda, who shares: “Health is not simply the absence of illness. Real health is the will to overcome every form of adversity and use even the worst of circumstances as a springboard for new growth and development. Simply put, the essence of health is the constant renewal and rejuvenation of life.” Even if people are not afflicted with an illness of the body, they may be struggling with an illness of the mind. And if they have overcome the illness of the mind as well, then the most important question to focus on is - how many people are leading value creating life each day to help and support others to lead a life of happiness and well being? This is the underlying spirit of SDG 3 - to leave no one behind - to build good health and develop a state of well being not just for oneself, but for many others as well.</p>`,

                      <p class="text-lg">The ultimate purpose of education, as with the purpose of life, can be expressed as "happiness".The word ‘happiness’ here refers to the sense of fulfilment that comes from developing and deepening one's humanity, rather than a more superficial state of simply being untroubled or having one's desires realized. Education, therefore, is not just about amassing degrees and knowledge, rather, it is the foundation for leading a happy, creative, and empowered life; one that is free of judgements, biases, ignorance, or discrimination of any kind. As the famous Tibetan proverb goes, “A child without education is like a bird without wings.” Education liberates us from the confines of our narrow self and empowers us to broaden our horizon and lead truly meaningful and fulfilling lives.</p>`,

SDG 4 recognises education as a human right, playing a transversal role in realizing any and all of the 17 SDGs.Without Education, we cannot build a truly just, happy, liberated and free world, nor achieve any of the other SDGs.</p>`,

It is the process of using knowledge as sustenance for fostering people who can demonstrate infinite creativity and self-reliance. Gaining knowledge is indispensable for guiding a changing society, but knowledge itself is not the same as creativity. Education must enable us to manifest our inner potential, and learning is just a catalyst for drawing that out.” The underlying spirit of SDG 4, in the words of Ikeda, is to Learn, Reflect and Empower.

                      <p class="text-lg">Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and therefore also half of its potential. But, today gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. Inequalities faced by girls can begin right at birth and follow them all their lives. Gender inequality impacts the lives of not just women, but all lives. Disadvantages in education translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market. Women’s and girls’ empowerment is essential to expand economic growth and promote social development. The full participation of women in labour forces would add percentage points to most national growth rates — double digits in many cases Gender equality is not merely a fundamental right. It is quintessential to the creation of a strong, just, peaceful, prosperous and sustainable society. Achieving gender equality will not impact just one SDG; in fact, if SDG 5 - Gender Equality is achieved, it will accelerate progress towards achieving all the other SDGs as well. </p>`,

Both are the key to accelerating progress toward the achievement of the entire spectrum of goals. “Women’s participation in conflict resolution and peace building has been expanding since the adoption of Resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council in 2000. But awareness of the importance of including women’s perspectives in the process of meeting global challenges is not limited to peace and conflict resolution. There’s much more to it. “The Sendai Framework launched in 2015 at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction notes that empowering women within disaster preparation is vital to enhancing resilience.

It can serve as the driving force to restore hope and the ability to advance in the face of the most challenging circumstances. “A Syrian woman in a refugee camp in Jordan who started to work as a tailor in a centre operated by UN Women, recounts, “We no longer feel helpless, our work makes us feel productive and empowered.” He further stresses that the 21st century must be a century of women, and expresses his belief, “The wisdom and power of women–their attentive commitment to reality, their care and concern for the people in their immediate surroundings, their capacity to treasure life itself– must be fully reflected throughout society. Only then will we see solid progress toward the resolution of critical global problems and realization of peace.”</p>`,

                       <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
                            <li>• Child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) have declined in recent years, and women’s representation in the political arena is higher than ever before.</li>
                            <li>• More girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage, more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership, and laws are being reformed to advance gender equality.</li>
                            <li>• More than 100 countries have taken action to track budget allocations for gender equality.</li>
                            <li>• In Southern Asia, a girl’s risk of marrying in childhood has dropped by over 40 percent since 2000.</li>
                            <li>• But the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality, and where all legal, social, and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled.</li>
                            <li>• In fact, that goal is probably even more distant than before, since women and girls are being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>

                      <p class="text-lg">Water is an essential building block of life. Approximately 70% of our blue planet is made up of water, as is 60% of our body. Water is invaluable to our health, food, culture, environment, and cities. However, Earth’s water is a finite resource. Less than 3% of this is freshwater, while the rest is saltwater found in oceans and seas. Further, most of the freshwater is frozen in glaciers, ice caps, or in deep underground aquifers. Only less than 1% of Earth’s water is freshwater that is easily accessible for fulfilling our needs. Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a basic human right. Water is essential for health, poverty reduction, food security, peace and human rights, ecosystems and education. However, countries are increasingly facing growing challenges pertaining to water scarcity, water pollution, degraded ecosystems and lack of cooperation over transboundary water resources. Further, the demand for water has outpaced growth in population, and half of the world population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month every year.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Since access to clean energy is a necessity of modern-day life, scaling up of renewable energy, such as solar, wind and thermal energy should be at the heart of combatting the looming climate crisis and for achieving the targets under SDG 7. For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels 789 million people around the world lack access to electricity produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on people’s well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few. Moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly. In a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies. A well-established energy system supports every sector, starting from business, medicine, education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-technology. Energy services are also key to preventing disease and fighting pandemics such as COVID-19, because they power healthcare facilities, supply clean water for essential hygiene, enable communications and IT services that connect people, while maintaining physical distance.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Without electricity, women and girls have to spend hours fetching water, clinics cannot store vaccines for children, many schoolchildren cannot do homework at night, and people cannot run competitive businesses. Slow progress towards clean cooking solutions is of grave global concern, affecting both human health and the environment, and if we don’t meet our goal by 2030, nearly a third of the world’s population – mostly women and children – will continue to be exposed to harmful household air pollution. President Ikeda has continued to highlight the need for renewable energy and energy conservation to reduce our environmental footprint in his various writings, while envisioning a ‘new energy future’. </p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Work gives our life meaning, by enabling us to contribute to the socio-economic goals of the society. Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, one in five countries – home to billions of people living in poverty – were likely to see per capita incomes decline in 2020. Now, the economic and financial shocks associated with the pandemic—such as disruptions to industrial production, financial market volatility, and rising insecurity—are derailing the already tepid economic growth and compounding heightened risks from other factors.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">President Ikeda shares in the 2013 Peace Proposal: “Economic deprivation makes virtually all the events of daily life into potential sources of distress. This is compounded when people feel that their very existence is disregarded, that they are alienated and deprived of a meaningful role and place within society.” He further elaborates: “This is why in recent years, in addition to economic measures to deal with the problem of poverty, there has been a growing emphasis on the need for a socially inclusive approach focused on the restoration of a sense of connection with others and of purpose in life.”  To achieve SDG 8, we need to envision and work towards a “win-win world”. Referring to the views of the first Soka Gakkai President - Mr. Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, President Ikeda emphasises in the 2009 Peace Proposal against the backdrop of the then global financial crisis on the need to make humanitarian competition the guiding principle of the new era - that is creating a world not based on egotistical pursuits, but also on improving the lives of others while improving one’s own life. </p>`,

            <p class="text-lg"Decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. Second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda once said: “There are three standards for selecting a job: the three values of beauty, benefit and good. Everyone's ideal is to get a job they like (beauty), that is materially rewarding (benefit), and where you can contribute to society (good).”</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">The global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6 percent, down from 6.4 percent in 2000. However, the pandemic has led to a devastating impact on global unemployment.  The global economy has been affected gravely since the start of the pandemic, despite best efforts by various countries and corporations. In fact, even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the average growth of the global economy had already slowed. The pandemic has caused the worst global economic recession since the Great Depression and has had a massive impact on working times and incomes. (UN) In 2020, 8.8 percent of global working hours were lost compared to the figure for the fourth quarter of 2019, which is equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs and approximately four times greater than the hours lost during the global financial crisis in 2009. </p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Young people and women in the workforce were hit particularly hard by the crisis in the labour market. The global economy is slowly recovering, although activity may remain below pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period.

Following average growth of about 2 percent from 2014 to 2018, global real GDP per capita increased by only 1.3 percent in 2019 and is estimated to have declined by 5.3 percent in 2020 owing to the pandemic. Global real GDP per capita is projected to increase again by 3.6 percent in 2021 and 2.6 percent in 2022.

The real GDP of the least developed countries increased by 4.8 percent in 2019 and is estimated to have fallen by 1.3 percent in 2020 because of the disruption caused by the pandemic.

In his 2017 Peace Proposal, Daisaku Ikeda shares - “Work is of course a crucial means of sustaining one's livelihood; at the same time, it gives meaning to life and is an endeavour to inscribe positive proof of one's existence in society. Former Chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation Dr. Stuart Rees, with whom I have recently published a dialogue, maintains that securing employment is an imperative in realizing social justice. In our dialogue, he shared his conviction that as a growing number of people are losing work, they are "being denied the profound human sense of self-worth that comes from work; either in the sense of earning one's keep, having the satisfaction of achieving something, or making a contribution to society."” He further stated that this represents a fundamental threat to human dignity.

Thus, as we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that those who have experienced economic deprivation are not left isolated or forgotten. 

Ikeda further highlights in the 2021 Peace Proposal: “The irrepressible desire to do what one can to help even one person, the awareness of and concern for others, the wholehearted action taken on their behalf that arises from living in the same community... I am confident such awareness and action, sustained and repeated despite differences of nationality or circumstance, can cultivate the soil from which resilience arises and grows.”</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">In the present day and age, infrastructure and industries, coupled with the increasing reach of the internet and technology, have become a major driving force towards economic growth, social development, climate action and many other major initiatives. Since there is a major shift in the manner of working of the world at large, industrialization and economic growth have become more crucial than ever before. A renewed emphasis on sustainability towards infrastructure, industrialization and innovation helps a long way towards making opportunities accessible for all and leading major change towards a more dynamic and sustainable world. 

The need to create sustained economic growth to improve the standard of living of millions was already an urgent necessity before COVID-19, however, now with the extensive disruptions in livelihoods and supply chains created by the pandemic, the need to accelerate the generation of employment and income while creating the infrastructure needed for providing basic utilities like clean water, energy, communication, and access to health care has greatly deepened.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Dynamic economic progress holds the key to address the challenges highlighted by several of the SDGs. Here, increasing investments in key industries and technologies especially in developing countries would be vital towards creating economic growth that is accessible and beneficial for all. Apart from the economic aspects, creating jobs and employment is fundamental to human dignity and is vital in elevating the sense of self-worth of the individual to contribute to the growth of their society. Together with industry, infrastructure too plays a vital role in both creating employment and enabling access to vital necessities. Basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries. In 2019, some 87 percent of people in developed countries used the Internet, compared with just 19 per cent in the least developed countries.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">The pandemic has also revealed a wide gap in the access to digital mediums and internet-based technologies, increasing the disparities in access to education and livelihood. According to the International Telecommunication Union (United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies) although there has been a strong growth in the access to the internet across the globe, with the number of people across the world who have used the internet surging from about 4.1 billion in 2019 to 4.9 billion in 2021, a staggering proportion of the world population, about 2.9 billion people have never used the internet, 96 percent of which are in developing countries. Moreover, even among those who are counted as internet users, many hundreds of millions have very limited access. SDG 9 while focusing on the growth of industry and infrastructure emphasizes the need for sustainability and innovation. Considering that all industrial and developmental activity is strongly related to environmental impacts including climate change, there is also an urgent requirement for innovation which creates sustainable growth and decouples economic activity and environmental impacts.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">SDG 10 deals with reducing inequalities within and among countries. At the very core of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals is the heart to ensure that no one is left behind, a vision which cannot be achieved without addressing the quality of life of the most vulnerable sections of society. Inequality here refers various kinds of disparities based on aspects like income, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion and opportunity. While ‘within countries’ the focus is to promote inclusive social and economic growth, on the other hand ‘among the countries’ there is a need for better representation of developing countries on key global platforms to ensure that both discussions and solutions for macro level challenges can be more credible. While inequalities were already severe towards the end of the last decade, the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with existing regional conflicts has greatly exacerbated and deepened the problem, hitting the poorest and the most vulnerable communities the hardest and diminishing the existing social safety nets that were already stressed.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Despite some positive signs, inequality is growing for more than 70% of the global population, multiplying the risks of divisions, and hampering economic and social development. Thus, it is important to ensure a life of dignity for all. Policies need to be universal and pay special attention to the disadvantaged and marginalized communities.  SGI President Daisaku Ikeda writes in the 2017 Peace Proposal: “Even if there is a sense of comfort felt by people when they are surrounded by others who share the same culture or ethnic group, we must remain vigilant against the danger that this group consciousness will metamorphose into violent discrimination or antagonism directed at other groups at times of heightened social tension… To categorize and discriminate against individuals on the basis of a single attribute is wrong; it is a source of division that undermines society as a whole.</p>`,

                text: `<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Why Should We Care About Reducing Inequalities In Society?</h1>
            <p class="text-lg">Deepening inequality not only impacts the poorest sections of the society but negatively impacts the entire society as a whole encompassing people across income levels. Inequality due to any reason hampers and threatens long term social and economic development. Inequality harms poverty reduction and destroys people’s sense of fulfilment and self-worth. This can result in crime, disease and environmental degradation. There can be no sustainable development if people are excluded from the chance to lead a better life. In his 2013 Peace Proposal President Ikeda discussed the work of researchers on why more equal societies do better, noting that “with greater inequality, people are less caring of one another, there is less mutuality in relationships, people have to fend for themselves and get what they can--so, inevitably, there is less trust." Further, because "inequality seems to make countries socially dysfunctional across a wide range of outcomes, it is not just the poor but people at almost all income levels who fare badly in more unequal societies.”</p>`,

Here, SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.  In his 2016 Peace Proposal SGI President Daisaku Ikeda highlights the role that cities can play in addressing key sustainability issues: “I would like to propose that the world's cities work together in paving the way toward promoting the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Although the world's cities only occupy 2 percent of the Earth's land area, they account for 75 percent of carbon emissions and more than 60 percent of energy consumption. While this means that cities' environmental footprint is disproportionately large, it also reflects the reality that if cities change, the world will change.”</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Because of their high concentrations of population many cities are also very vulnerable to natural calamities, social unrest etc. Since 2008, over half of the world’s population has been living in urban environments and that share is set to rise to 60 percent by 2030. One of the key driving forces behind this increase has been the fact that cities are the engines of economic growth, contributing about 70 percent to the global GDP. The rapid urbanisation, however, has also become a source for intensifying inequalities and environmental challenges, leading to growth in urban slums, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure like roads, transport, waste collection, water and sanitation systems and worsening air pollution. According to estimates by the United Nations, over 1 billion people live in slums today and with over 90 percent of urban growth forecasted to happen in Asia and Africa in the next 30 years, there is an urgent requirement to create sustainable urban spaces, especially in developing countries. Although the challenges emanating from the growth of cities and urban settlements are immense and pose multiple obstacles to the achievement of SDGs, there is also great opportunity for innovative solutions. Due to their density, urban spaces present great opportunities to create synergies between the economy, environment and social benefits. </p>`,

In his 2011 Peace Proposal, he writes: “The confidence and joy of knowing that our daily action, dialogue and engagement are moving the world in a better direction--this unleashes hitherto unimagined energy and power from within people's lives. We are moved by the knowledge that each of the world's seemingly ordinary individuals can be a protagonist in the creation of a new era.

            <p class="text-lg">With the global production and consumption of goods and services relying primarily on the use of natural resources, the industrial progress over the last century has been strongly accompanied by destructive effects on the biosphere. SDG 12 deals with de-linking economic growth and environmental degradation, doing more with less, increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles. The response to the challenge of decoupling economic growth and environmental degradation needs to be rooted in enabling humanity to realise the preciousness of the natural environment SGI President Daisaku Ikeda shares: “Humanity can no longer sustain a civilisation based on mass production and mass consumption. There is not an unlimited supply of natural resources at our disposal. Unless we change our way of thinking, the human race is going to reach an impasse. In this regard, I have stressed the need for people to take note of the life-philosophy of Buddhism that teaches the harmonious coexistence of humankind and nature” (The New Human Revolution, Vol. 20 – A novel by President Ikeda)</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Earth Overshoot Day, an initiative which marks the date when humanity’s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what Earth can regenerate in that year, estimates that humanity is presently using nature 1.8 times faster than our planet’s biocapacity can regenerate. According to the latest projections, the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050. The equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.  Achieving SDG 12 depends on simple actions on a day to day basis by both producers and consumers, which can result in responsible consumption and production practices. For example, reducing food loss and waste can contribute to environmental sustainability by resulting in lower production costs and increased efficiency of food systems. Producers/Businesses’ benefit by finding new solutions enabling sustainable consumption and production patterns, through better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services, product life cycles and how these are affected by use within lifestyles. They can also help in identifying critical areas of the value chain and intervene in such areas to massively improve the environmental and social impact of the system as a whole. Innovation and design solutions can also result in inspiring individuals to lead more sustainable lifestyles.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. The world is already witnessing the effects of climate change, with increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, and more frequent and severe weather events. The effects of climate change are being felt by people and communities around the world, particularly those who are most vulnerable. SDG 13 focuses on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. In his 2019 Peace Proposal, SGI President Daisaku Ikeda highlights the importance of taking action on climate change: “The climate crisis is a global challenge that requires a global response. It is a challenge that transcends national borders and affects all of humanity. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, and the situation is likely to worsen in the coming years. We must act now to address this crisis and protect our planet for future generations.”</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">In his 2020 Peace Proposal SGI President Daisaku Ikeda shares: “Climate change is more than an environmental issue in the conventionally understood sense: It represents a threat to all people living on Earth, both now and in future generations. It is, like nuclear weapons, a fundamental challenge on which the fate of humankind hinges… Indeed, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, climate change is “the defining issue of our time.” The impacts of climate change threaten to render meaningless global efforts to eliminate poverty and hunger, as set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” Despite the multipronged efforts to shift the global economy towards low carbon pathways, climate change continues unabated. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, with the warmest seven years all coming since 2015; top three being 2016, 2019 and 2020. According to a UN report, the year 2021 though temporarily cooled by La Niña events was still amongst the seven warmest years on record and is remembered for a record-shattering temperature of nearly 50°C in Canada, comparable to the values reported in the hot Saharan Desert of Algeria, exceptional rainfall, and deadly flooding in Asia and Europe as well as drought in parts of Africa and South America. 2021 was also the 7th consecutive year where global temperature continued to be 1° C above pre-industrial levels.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">According to IPCC Chair Dr. Hoesung Lee: “We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming, I am encouraged by climate action being taken in many countries. There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective.  If these are scaled up and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.” In terms of action, day-to-day efforts to curb climate change become critical. Every action towards combating climate action will have a manifold impact, resulting in creation of more jobs, great prosperity, and better lives for all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. President Ikeda writes in the 2016 Peace Proposal: “The challenges that confront humankind, such as poverty or natural disasters, manifest themselves uniquely depending on location and circumstance. And as I mentioned with reference to climate change, the impacts of different threats are such that they can affect anyone, anywhere, at any time. That is why day-to-day efforts are needed in each locality to enhance resilience- -the capacity to prevent crises or their escalation and the ability to act with wisdom to respond flexibly and energetically to difficult conditions in the aftermath of disaster.”</p>`,

In his 2022 Peace Proposal SGI President  Daisaku Ikeda shares: “The resources we all require in order to survive, and flourish are together known as the “global commons” ... The global commons encompass the high seas and the North and South Poles, none of which fall under the sovereign purview of any single nation, as well as the atmosphere and global ecosystem, resources that are essential for humanity to survive and thrive.

            <p class="text-lg">It is the ocean which drives global systems and makes the earth habitable for humankind. The sea regulates rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, food, and even the oxygen in the air. Therefore, careful management of oceans, seas and marine resources is essential towards a sustainable future. Presently however, there is continuous deterioration of coastal waters due to pollution, and ocean acidification is having a negative impact on the proper functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity. This also affects small scale fisheries. Thus, saving the ocean is very important. Further, marine biodiversity is quintessential to the health of people and our planet. Marine protected areas require to be effectively managed, well-resourced and regulations need to be established to reduce overfishing, marine pollution and acidification of ocean.  Systemic and local efforts are key. Establishing comprehensive, effective and equitably managed systems of government-protected areas plays an important role in biodiversity conservation and ensures a sustainable future for the fishing industry. Local efforts such as making ocean-friendly choices while buying products, selecting certified products, eliminating plastic usage and spreading the message on the importance of marine life also supplements the systemic efforts towards achieving this Goal.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Nature and environment is critical to survival of all lives. They provide oxygen for survival, regulate weather patterns, pollinate crops, produce food, feed and fibre. Nature and the environment are, however, under increasing pressure and stress, mainly due to human activity. Human activity has affected nearly 75% of the earth’s surface, and is squeezing wildlife and nature into an ever-increasing smaller corner of the planet. Deforestation, species extinction are just two of the many negative impacts on nature and the environment. The goal of ‘Life on Land’ is critical towards supporting healthy ecosystems, which in turn keep people and all forms of life healthy. Involvement of local communities is a key aspect towards developing and managing such healthy ecosystems.</p>`,

            <p class="text-lg">Creating strong, accountable and inclusive institutions foster a sense of justice and fairness among people, and thus help in creating a peaceful society. People everywhere need to be free of fear from any form of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives irrespective of their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. Conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice remain threats to sustainable development. Governments, civil society and communities must collaborate and work together, right upto the individual level, and create lasting solutions to reduce violence, deliver justice, fight corruption and ensure inclusive participation at all times. Quoting the noted economist Amartya Sen, SGI President Daisaku Ikeda writes  in his 2017 Peace Proposal: “the roles of institutions, rules and organization, important as they are, have to be assessed in the broader and more inclusive perspective of nyaya, which is inescapably linked with the world that actually emerges, not just the institutions or rules we happen to have.”</p>`,

                text: `<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Why Is It Important To revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development?</h1>
            <p class="text-lg">Sustainable Development can be achieved only through strong global partnerships and cooperation. Strong inclusive partnerships at every level, starting from the grassroots, till the national, regional and global levels are quintessential. Such partnerships must be built upon principles and values, a shared vision and shared goals, which place people and the planet at the forefront. This has become even more crucial after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted the world negatively from many aspects. Strong partnerships are key to revive the world from such negative impacts. Everyone, starting from governments, civil society, scientists, academia, the private sector and finally individuals need to come together at this crucial juncture. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 goals, is universal and requires action by every single segment of society, irrespective of their roles in the society. It is essential to ensure that no one is left behind. SGI President Daisaku Ikeda urges us to create “a consciousness of solidarity that extends to the entire world”. He shares: “Such a spirit of solidarity will provide the driving energy and basis for meeting the full spectrum of our challenges, including the climate crisis. I am certain that by rooting our actions in this spirit of solidarity and by making progress in the construction of a global society that can remain undefeated before any threat, we will leave something of immense value to future generations.”</p>`,
